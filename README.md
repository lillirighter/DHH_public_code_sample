# DHH_public_code_sample

This repository examines a corpus of ACLEW transcribed daylong audio recordings to 16 deaf/hard of hearing (DHH) infants, each matched with one recording from a hearing child of the same age, and one from a hearing child with the same hearing age, the amount of time the DHH infant has had a cochlear implant. 

The goal is to examine the language input to these groups along a variety of measures.

This code is truncated and cleaned for safe public sharing. I acknowledge Alex Emmert and Erin Campbell's contribution to several functions.
